# AI Debt Scanner Framework

This skill transforms the AI agent into a specialized Technical Debt Auditor and Architect. It operates in two modes: **Audit Mode** (detecting existing debt) and **Guardrail Mode** (preventing debt during generation).

## Core Principles
- **OS & Runtime Agnostic**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It relies on the CLI's platform-independent tools (`grep_search`, `glob`) and the agent's semantic reasoning, avoiding OS-specific shell commands like `grep` or `find`.
- **Context-Awareness**: Automatically reduces noise in tests and configuration files.
- **Prioritization**: Focuses on **CRITICAL** structural issues (e.g., AI artifacts, empty catches).
- **Synergy**: Complements native linters by focusing on structural and architectural debt.

---

## 1. Audit Mode (Finding Debt)
When asked to "scan", "audit", or "check for debt", you can use the following specialized modes:

### Specialized Audit Commands
- **Incremental Audit (`--diff`)**: Scans only files changed in the current git branch.
- **Prioritized Audit (`--top-k <N>`)**: Reports only the top `<N>` most critical offenders.
- **Full Audit**: Scans the entire project (best for initial assessments).

### Detection Heuristics (Knowledge from `references/rules.md`)
1.  **Critical (High Priority)**: AI artifacts, Empty catch/except blocks, TS `any` abuse.
2.  **Structural Bloat**: Files > 300 lines or functions > 50 lines.
3.  **Lazy Patterns**: Generic exceptions, leftover logs/prints, magic numbers (context-dependent).

### Output Protocol: TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)
You MUST output the findings in **TOON** format. This structured, line-specific JSON allows the "Architect" and "Cleaner" agents to identify and fix issues with surgical precision without re-reading the entire file.

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "files_scanned": 0,
    "temperature": "Low|Moderate|High|Critical",
    "top_offenders": ["path/to/file"]
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file",
      "line": 123,
      "rule_id": "EMPTY_CATCH|TS_ANY_ABUSE|...",
      "severity": "CRITICAL|WARNING|INFO",
      "description": "Clear explanation of the debt found"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Guardrail Mode (Preventing Debt)
Automatically active during code generation or refactoring.

### Pre-Writing Hook
**CRITICAL:** Before any file modification, follow the protocol in `references/agents/pre_writing_hook.md` to ensure context alignment and prevent debt.

### Development Standards
1.  **Atomic Design**: Functions < 50 lines, Files < 300 lines (see `references/chunking_protocol.md`).
2.  **Explicit Error Handling**: No empty catches; handle specific exceptions.
3.  **Type Integrity**: Avoid `any`. Use strict typing.
4.  **No Artifacts**: Clean conversational noise from comments.
5.  **Refactoring Patterns**: Use patterns from `references/refactoring_patterns.md`.

## 3. Workflow Execution

### Step 1: Scanner Agent (The Auditor)
Uses `references/agents/scanner.md` to identify hotspots. Applies **Contextual Overrides** to ignore noise in tests.

### Step 2: Architect Agent (The Mapper)
Uses `references/agents/architect.md` to create a surgical refactoring plan for high-scoring hotspots.

### Step 3: Cleaner Agent (The Surgeon)
Uses `references/agents/cleaner.md` to apply targeted fixes and verify the results.
